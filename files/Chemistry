Two aqueous solutions, one containing <1,10> g of sodium carbonate and the other <1,20> g of ca lcium chloride, are mixed together. A precipitation reaction occurs: Na2C03(aq) + CaCl2(aq) - > 2NaCl(aq) + CaC03(s) Determine the limiting reagent and the mass, in g, of precipitate formed (the theoretical yield).
A solution of <100,200> g of potassium iodide, Kl is added to a solution of <100,200> g of nitric acid, HN03. The acid acts as an oxidizing agent. 6Kl(aq) + 8HN03(aq) -> 6KN03(aq) + 2NO(g) + 312 (s) + 4H20(I) a) Deduce which reagent is in excess. b) Determine how many grams of this reactant will remain unreacted. c) Determine how many grams of nitrogen monoxide, NO will be produced.
Chlorine gas is produced by the reaction of hydrochloric acid, and the oxidizing agent manganese(IV) oxide, Mn02: Mn02(s) + 4HCl(aq) - > MnCl2(aq) + Cl2(g) + 2H20(1) At 273.15 Kand 100 kPa, <10,100> g of HCI reacts with 0.35 mol of Mn02 to produce <10,100> dm3 of chlorine gas. a) Deduce the limiting reagent. b) Calculate the theoretical yield of chlorine.
